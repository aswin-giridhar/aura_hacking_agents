# WhatsApp AI Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
Your LoveCoach AI app now includes full WhatsApp integration with Mistral AI. Users can chat directly with your AI dating coach through WhatsApp, powered by your Mistral API key.

## Your Configuration
Your Twilio credentials are already configured:

```bash
# Mistral AI Configuration (Already set)
MISTRAL_API_KEY=B912vIZxj3H3USwTGpg1TOkfoybltQDd

# Twilio Configuration (Already configured)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=US6d053382f8b294e23058861dd6cc3302
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=d8c7e8d5f9c8b2c86efce1f53143fae3
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+14155238886
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155238886
```

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Configure Twilio Webhook**
   - Go to your Twilio Console: https://console.twilio.com
   - Navigate to Messaging > Settings > WhatsApp sandbox
   - Set webhook URL to: `https://your-repl-name.replit.app/webhook/whatsapp`
   - Set HTTP method to POST
   - Save the configuration

2. **Test the Integration**
   - Click the floating WhatsApp button on your website
   - It will open WhatsApp Web with your business number
   - Send a message to test the AI response

3. **WhatsApp Business Account (If needed)**
   - Your current setup uses Twilio's sandbox
   - For production, you'll need WhatsApp Business API approval
   - This allows custom branding and removes sandbox limitations
